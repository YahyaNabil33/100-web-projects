Now outside of coding, I’m into sports like tennis, table tennis, and basketball, and I enjoy staying active and challenging myself. I also love programming in general and experimenting with small projects to improve my skills.

I’m always curious, learning new things, and pushing myself to grow both personally and professionally. I believe that with dedication and practice, I can achieve my goal of becoming a pro web developer.</p>
